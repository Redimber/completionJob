//In this programming problem and the next you'll code up the greedy algorithms from lecture
//for minimizing the weighted sum of completion times.. Download the text file here.
//This file describes a set of jobs with positive and integral weights and lengths. It has the format
//[number_of_jobs]
//[job_1_weight] [job_1_length]
//[job_2_weight] [job_2_length]
//...
//For example, the third line of the file is "74 59", indicating that the second job has weight 74 and length 59.
//You should NOT assume that edge weights or lengths are distinct.
//For this problem, use the same data set as in the previous problem.
//
//Your task now is to run the greedy algorithm that schedules jobs (optimally) in decreasing order of the ratio (weight/length). In this algorithm,
//it does not matter how you break ties. You should report the sum of weighted completion times of the resulting schedule --- a positive integer
//--- in the box below.
