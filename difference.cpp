//In this programming problem and the next you'll code up the greedy algorithms from lecture
//for minimizing the weighted sum of completion times.. Download the text file here.
//This file describes a set of jobs with positive and integral weights and lengths. It has the format
//[number_of_jobs]
//[job_1_weight] [job_1_length]
//[job_2_weight] [job_2_length]
//...
//For example, the third line of the file is "74 59", indicating that the second job has weight 74 and length 59.
//You should NOT assume that edge weights or lengths are distinct.
//Your task in this problem is to run the greedy algorithm that schedules jobs in
//decreasing order of the difference (weight - length). Recall from lecture that this algorithm
//is not always optimal. IMPORTANT: if two jobs have equal difference (weight - length),
//you should schedule the job with higher weight first. Beware: if you break ties in a different way,
//you are likely to get the wrong answer. You should report the sum of weighted completion times
//of the resulting schedule --- a positive integer --- in the box below.
